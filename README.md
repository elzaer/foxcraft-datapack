# Foxcraft Datapack Overview
Custom Minecraft Mod for a more interesting Survival Experience.  This data-pack attempts to keep the Vanilla experience but adding spice and flavour to keep it interesting.  Some of the loot tables, game rules and configurations are designed to stop the shortcut hacks to obtaining equipment, enchantments etc.

# Custom Trader
Custom wandering trader that sells special equipment and items for diamonds only.  Making diamonds the currency means that it is not easy to exploit resource constraints.  The trader also has the trades locked behind the Player Rank - so low ranked players are not able to purchase the top tier goods.

# Hunger Increase
Each night that the player passes and doesn't sleep - hunger toll is increased by 50%

# Mending books diabled
The only source of mending books is via the custom wandering trader (or through the fishing loot table).  This is to prevent the villager trade shortcuts
